# weatherapitask
to load csv data containing cities and to get particular details we want through accessing API.

Here we have used the apiweather API to get the weather information of the cities which we got as input through a CSV file.
We take that as an input into our code by using pandas to read it as a dataframe and store the details then passing them to the URL "Q" parameter and also the key by using python Requests library.
As aresult we get the output csv file with the details which we want to be in the Output CSV file.
